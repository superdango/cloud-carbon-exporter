## Estimating power consumption

### Block storage

According to a [Google Cloud blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/high-durability-persistent-disk) on persistent disks, durability is always equal to or greater than that of three-way replication. Data blocks are distributed across multiple physical disks and storage-dedicated racks. As result, single physical disk typically hosts multiple virtual disks.

In this model, a block disk is assumed to represent a fraction of three 2 TB physical disks, with an additional 10% added to account for rack overhead.

For example, a 1 TB block disk is estimated to consume the equivalent of 1.5 physical disks (3 Ã— 1 TB) plus 10% overhead.

### Object storage

Based on the [AWS re:Invent 2024 - Dive deep on Amazon S3 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXehLy7IiPM) here are our key assumptions:

   * Object storage is backed by HDDs
   * Each drive has a capacity of 20 TB
   * A JBOD server holds approximately 1,000 drives
   * Due to erasure coding, each byte requires 1.8x the physical storage
   * We account for an additional 40% overhead

The formula used for object storage is: `(bucket size in TB x 1.8) / 20 TB * HDD power * 1.4`
